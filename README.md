# Console-Game-With-Editor
 A Top-Down Shooter Game made on the Console that comes with an In-Game Editor! 

## About
I made this project as a challenge to make a Game on the Console without using any external libraries or frameworks.
With only the Windows API used to configure the Console, this project has and uses its own:
- Interface to the Windows Terminal for Changing Size and Drawing Objects.
- Entity Component System (ECS) for Managing Game Objects' Properties and Behaviour.
- Simple Minimal Logger for Debugging.
- In-Game Level Editor for people to make their own Unique Enemy Hordes where each Enemy can have different Paths to Follow and Shooting Patterns.
- File Manager to read and write different hordes.
